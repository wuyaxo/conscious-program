# conscious-program

Carlos Rodriguez

Please note this is extra curricular work :) ELAC and Cal State L.A. is working together on a Grant for designing Conscious programming . There are two groups from ELAC: Professor Khollesi and us
The objective is to design and create a more conscious program to level the playing field .
As the instructor I will designing the criteria for you to follow, All of the work will be student base and completed as detailed as we can.

So if we look at current programs on the internet , they ask us the end-user to fill out forms.

If we look at this a little closer , there are a lot of information that describes the potential candidate, thus creating potential bias.

address
name

My thought is to create a Java form :
registration form
log-in form

Registration form:
First name
Last name
cell number
address
city
zip code

As part of phase I: we can test the results to see if it works

Then move towards Phase II:
every time a person fills in first and last name it create a random number associated to the original name .

we can do the same to city and zip code

if this works then we can move towards final section:

original registration can go to your email : as phase I
Now lets set up an excel sheet that will save the names to an excel spreadsheet.

This way we avoid building a database

The work can be divided into different components ( pieces of the puzzle)

registration form
log in form

both need to interact with each other

excel spread sheet and conversion from Java to excel

random numbers converter
